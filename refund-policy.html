        <p class="lead">Last Updated: November 4, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>At Introscale, we are committed to delivering high-quality, performance-based digital marketing services. This Refund & Cancellation Policy outlines the terms under which you may request a refund or cancel your subscription.</p>

        <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Refunds are applicable only under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If we fail to deliver the number of qualified, booked appointments as outlined in your service agreement.</li>
          <li>If a duplicate payment was made due to a technical error.</li>
          <li>If the service was purchased but never initiated due to internal reasons on our part.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refunds are not applicable for partial service usage, client-side delays, or performance beyond our control.</p>

        <h2>3. Refund Process</h2>
        <p>To request a refund, please email info@introscale.com
 with your campaign details and results summary. Once your request is verified, approved refunds will be processed within 7–10 business days to the original payment method.</p>
        <p>Cancellations made before campaign launch are eligible for a full refund. Cancellations made after launch but before 30 days are not eligible, as the service is already in execution.</p>

        <h2>4. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>Clients may cancel their service subscription with a <strong>30-day written notice</strong> before the next billing cycle. Cancellations made after renewal will take effect in the next cycle.</p>

        <h2>5. Exceptions</h2>
        <p>No refunds will be issued once the guaranteed results have been achieved, or if campaign data shows leads were generated as per service commitments.</p>
